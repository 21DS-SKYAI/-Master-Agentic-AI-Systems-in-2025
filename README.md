 # 🤖 Learning AI Agents — 

This repository outlines everything I’m learning to master **Agentic AI Systems** in 2025.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this roadmap will guide you through the essential skills required to build, deploy, and scale intelligent agent-based AI systems.

## 🔑 Core Programming Skills

Essential for building reliable and scalable AI agents.

| Skill | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| 🐍 **Python** | Most Agentic AI frameworks are Python-based. |
| 🧪 **OOP Concepts** | Enables modular, class-driven agent design. |
| 🔁 **Async Programming** | Required for agents running parallel tasks and event loops. |
| 🧱 **Data Structures** | Helps manage tools, memory, and workflow states. |

**Tools I’m practicing:** `asyncio`, `multiprocessing`, `threading`

## 🧠 LLMs & Prompting Foundations

Understanding how LLMs think is the foundation of smart agent behavior.

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| ✍️ **Prompt Engineering** | Designing structured prompts, ReAct workflows, role prompts. |
| 🧠 **LLM Understanding** | GPT, Claude, Mistral — how they reason and plan. |
| 🧾 **Token & Context Management** | Required for long-term memory and multi-step agents. |

**Core Concepts:** ReAct, Chain of Thought, Reflection, Toolformer, CAMEL

## 🔗 Agent Frameworks & Tooling

The frameworks I’m learning to build real agent pipelines:

| Toolkit | What I use it for |
|---------|--------------------|
| 🔗 **LangChain** | Tools, memory, chains, and agent wrappers. |
| 🧠 **LangGraph** | Graphs, loops, workflow control, retries. |
| 👥 **CrewAI** | Multi-agent collaboration workflows. |
| 🤝 **AutoGen** | Chat/task agents that collaborate. |
| 🧰 **Vector DBs** | Chroma, Pinecone, FAISS for semantic memory. |

Also exploring: Haystack, LlamaIndex, HuggingFace Transformers

## ☁️ Cloud & API Integrations

To move agents from notebook experiments to production.

| Tool / Skill | Why I’m Learning It |
|--------------|----------------------|
| ☁️ **AWS / GCP** | Hosting, serverless execution, scaling. |
| 🔌 **API Integrations** | Agents must interact with real tools/data. |
| ⚡ **Flask / FastAPI** | Build production-ready agent APIs. |
| 🌐 **Streamlit / Gradio** | Build interactive agent dashboards/UI. |

---

## 🧭 Agent Design & Cognitive Patterns

The core of agent intelligence — how agents plan, think, and act.

| Concept | What I'm Building |
|---------|--------------------|
| 🧠 **Reflexion** | Agents that critique themselves and retry tasks. |
| 🧭 **Planning & Scheduling** | Goal → Plan → Subtasks → Actions. |
| 🗂️ **Memory Systems** | Short-term, episodic, and long-term memory. |
| 🧠 **Belief-State Modeling** | Agents tracking their environment/state. |
| 👥 **Multi-Agent Collaboration** | Teams of specialized agents working together. |

## 🔥 Optional (But Powerful) Add-ons

| Skill | Why I Track It |
|-------|----------------|
| 🧪 **Experiment Tracking** | Debugging, evaluation, reproducibility. |
| 🤖 **HuggingFace Transformers** | Fine-tuning/custom model workflows. |
| 💬 **RAG Pipelines** | Building factual, memory-enabled agents. |
| 🧩 **Graph Theory** | Agent decision flow and orchestration. |
| 🛡️ **Cybersecurity Basics** | Safe & secure agent interactions. |
